# R Markdown Dashboard
## Getting started creating R Markdown dashboards. <br>

This repository contains the code used to create the R Shiny Markdown Dashboard available on my Personal Website at this [link](https://pierpaolo28.github.io/Projects/project15.html). <br>

Additionally, are available two Dashboard realised following two different tutorials by [Dr. Bharatendra Rai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a4S4tq62OE) and  [Stat Pharm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H64zJqmzrMs).
